# Admission Prediction with Machine Learning
This project predicts if a student will get an admission (on based on his/her GRE score, GPA score and University rank) to university or not.

This is a classification problem. I have implemented following parts in this project.

1. Data Visualization and Correction
2. Data analysis with graphs using Seaborn
3. Predict the accuracy with Sigmoid activation function
4. Find the overall accuracy with the Sklearn Machine learning modules like 'Logistic Regression'.
5. we create a web app using Flask which is a python micro framework.
