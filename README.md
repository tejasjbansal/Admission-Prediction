# Admission Prediction with Machine Learning
This project predicts if a student will get an admission (on based on his/her GRE score, GPA score and University rank) to university or not.

This is a classification problem. I have implemented following parts in this project.

1. Data Visualization and Correction
2. Data analysis with graphs using Seaborn
3. Predict the accuracy with Sigmoid activation function
4. Find the overall accuracy with different Sklearn Machine learning modules like 'Logistic Regression' , 'Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)' , 'K Neighbour Classifier' ,          'Decision Tree Classifier' , 'Random Forest Classifier' , 'Naive Bayes' and 'Support Vector Machine'.
See the Jupyter Notebook for more details about code and pipeline explanation.
